This Shiny web application is used to add a smoothing line to the output of the Airpassengers dataset, which is built in in R. You can access it with "AirPassengers". It contains the monthly Airline Passenger Numbers from 1949-1960. 

By adjusting the slider for the smoothing parameter the smoothing line, colored in red, will change accordingly. The lower the value the more reactive the smoothing is.
